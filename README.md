- temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
- set a manual temperature range
- save temperature data as csv or png file

- streamlit app (`pip install streamlit`) [Streamlit â€¢ A faster way to build and share data apps](https://streamlit.io/). Start the script with `streamlit run app.py`

ðŸ’¡ a quick tip:
You can open the downloaded csv image file in [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej/) (`file->import text image`) and do more interesting things directly with the temperature data. Linescan profiles for example.
