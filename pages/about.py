ðŸ’¡ a quick tip: You can open the downloaded csv image file in [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej/) (`file->import text image`) and do more interesting image processing things directly with the temperature data. Linescan profiles for example.

ðŸ’¡ Use the 'blackbody' profile to indicate highlight cliping when using a manual temperature scale
