### viewer and raw converter for jpg files created by the Infiray P2Pro infrared camera using the original software
[see the source code on github ks00x/p2proviewer](https://github.com/ks00x/p2proviewer)

Klaus Schwarzburg 2024

ðŸ’¡ the image viewer has several options to zoom and save bitmap images. Check the icon bar on the top!

ðŸ’¡ a quick tip: You can open the downloaded csv image file in [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej/) (`file->import text image`) and do more interesting image processing things directly with the temperature data. Linescan profiles for example.

ðŸ’¡ Use the 'blackbody' profile to indicate highlight cliping when using a manual temperature scale

ðŸ’¡ Check out [this repo](https://github.com/ks00x/p2pro-live) for a Python/Streamlit app to use the P2Pro on the Windows desktop
